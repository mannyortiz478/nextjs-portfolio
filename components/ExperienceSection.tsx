    description: "Collaborated with Dr. Junfeng Yang in the Software Systems Lab at Columbia University, where I generated deepfake audio using open-source text-to-speech models with large datasets and evaluated the robustness of these models through comprehensive benchmark tests. I developed an audio deepfake detection model utilizing LSTM architecture and tested it on the generated deepfake datasets. Additionally, I created and managed Linux servers on Google Cloud Platform, employing various Linux commands and optimizing resource usage. I also wrote Python scripts to download deepfake audio, split them into smaller segments, and incorporate them into a new dataset for lab research.",

    description: "I engineered and implemented AI-driven career pathways using OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT, leveraging data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and ONET through prompt engineering. Created a comprehensive career guidance system offering three distinct pathways for each career: Classic Path, Out of the Box Path, and Budget-Friendly Path. Each pathway includes detailed, step-by-step guidance with checkboxes for user progress tracking. Developed a user-friendly job board, similar to Indeed, to facilitate job searches, allowing users to efficiently search and apply for jobs. Currently developing an AI chatbot that serves as a Career Readiness Assistant, helping users with inquiries such as optimizing LinkedIn profiles for job searches, drafting SMART goals, and standing out to potential employers. Continuously improving user experience by integrating advanced AI technologies and providing personalized career advice and job search assistance.",
